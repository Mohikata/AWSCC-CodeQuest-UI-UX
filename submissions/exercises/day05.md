- Brief explanation of your experience or reflection
  After finishing the advanced figma tutorial, learning about the pen tool, auto layout, grids and constraints, i've noticed that these tools would require me to practice them some more for a better mastery over using them. The guide was well done, having something to follow on while learning helps a lot, which made me understood the following concepts quite well. I will now use all of the lessons I've learned here in my future projects.
- An **optional** screenshot of playing the games provided in Day 5 and your feedback
