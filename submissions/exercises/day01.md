#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: I find Lazada a little easier to navigate compared to shopee in regard to finding products. Although both has a search bar on top, and neither seems to have categories for items to buy (at least at after a few minutes of looking), I just find Lazada easier to use due to less clutter. It also goes straight to product suggestions.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: Honestly, there are a lot. For first time users, they have a purpose in mind when using these kinds of apps, that is to look for a specific product or at least window shop, however a lot of pop-ups for deals, games and prizes confuses the first-time users. Not only pop-ups but on the top of the page is filled with it. 

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Comparing the two platforms, I find Lazada to be a little easier to use. This is coming from someone who barely used both applications. I still think that both applications are confusing to use.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: My answer may be a little biased, I find neither application that pleasing to the eyes. Concerning the layouts in regard to their branding, I think they did an okay job.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: This aspect I had no qualms about it. They did a fine job.
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: If I had to choose it would be shopee, even though it is cluttered.
