- Brief explanation of your experience or reflection
As a first time user of figma, i can already see how useful it can be when designing, as a person who focuses more on backend, trying out UI/UX, I always find myself stumped when it comes to this, and this is something i want to change, and with figma makes my learning experience better.
Ready to include your output for **Day 2**? Let the customization begin! ðŸš€âœ¨
